When only the essentials are needed, our microsite is perfect. Everything fits on one page that’s designed solely to sell your game. Here’s a breakdown of all the features.
## Entire Site
We create a bespoke design inspired by the look of game you’re selling. Attention is paid to the overall tone, colors, fonts, section labels, content frames, background images, and foreground elements.
## Hero Section
Your key art, packaging shot, sales copy, and call-to-action are expertly placed with responsive design
## Trailer Section
We design this section to highlight the trailer thumbnail and invite views
## Purchase Section
We make it easy to sell multiple editions or versions of your game for every platform on which they’re available
## Gallery
We hand-select your most exciting screen shots
## Options
If you need to advertise DLC, include a download code form, or include multilingual content, just let us know
## Technical
On top of design, we’ll collaborate with your marketing team to maximize your sales. We can add special promotions, make the site multilingual, insert your sales data trackers, and integrate social media to help spread the word and drive traffic. And don’t worry about the technical side—we handle hosting, security, global content delivery, and all the necessary consent management for every site we build.
