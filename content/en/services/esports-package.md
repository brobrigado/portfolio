People love competitive video games. One of the more famous players, Hajime “Tokido” Taniguchi, said it best while celebrating on-stage after winning the world’s largest Street Fighter tournament: [“Fighting game... is something SO great."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tN0zi8eino&t=6) - and the thousands in attendance applauded whole-heartedly. They shared his love for the game and the community that surrounds it. Collectively, they had dedicated countless hours to mastering it. Most of them had entered this tournament themselves. They all understood “something so great.”

So how can this understanding and celebration be shared with those who play only a little? Or not at all? How can this greatness become part of more people's lives? What does it take to turn them into an audience of fans that express their support by loving and purchasing your game, its downloadable content, related merchandise, and sponsored products?

Game publishers like you know the answer is making your game not only fun to play… but fun to watch. You can do it with esports - because there’s no better way to package top-tier gameplay, personalities, and excitement. You know you’ll need a website to deliver esports worldwide. We hope you chose us to create it.

Everyone in our company is competitive and most of us play fighting games. We run tournaments. We help build the community. We were fortunate enough to become a CAPCOM vendor back in 2012. And, in 2014, they entrusted us with designing, building, launching, and hosting capcomprotour.com. It was our official global esports website debut and the site appealed to everyone who used it: **Fans, players, content creators, administrators, and sponsors.**
## Fans
Some fans know your game and its best players. Some like stats. Others want only action. If your game is enjoyed world-wide, we can reach all enthusiasts by providing exciting, easy-to-find content in multiple languages. We connect global fans to your esports tour website the same way we connect every page on the site: By providing intuitive paths. All pages help fans understand every facet of esports. Player pages introduce top competitors to newcomers through the sharing of gamer handles, photos, stats, bios, and the character they use. Standings let everyone know who’s best. A Champions page honors the best of all time. Tournament videos show off elite competition. The Schedule talks about what’s coming next and what happened earlier in the season. Regular news compels fans to come back to your website week-after-week.
## Players
Serious competitors use an esports website to plan their entire season of competition. The Rules answer questions about eligibility and prize money. Players can sort the Schedule by event type and region to help them select tournaments to enter. When registration opens, the site provides links to sign-up. As the season progresses, players can track themselves, their friends, and their rivals with the Standings page. And when competitors perform well enough to become part of the tour, they get a Player page of their own to share with family and friends in hopes of bringing in more fans.
## Content creators
Streamers and content creators wanting to talk about your esports tour or use it as a resource to tell stories have a vast repository of current events and history at their disposal. The tour website comes with a powerful search tool to help them research with ease. It’s their ideal source for describing a player’s growth, talking about what happened yesterday, or sharing thoughts on the game itself with their legions of subscribers.
## Administrators
Making weekly updates to a website should be easy. Trusted web admins assure us we've made it that way. Most updates can be completed in three or four steps. Our esports technology simplifies even the critical tasks: All the math for points and stat calculation is handled by the website. After any event, the site admins need only log in, add new players, and use drop-downs to assign their placement in that weekend’s tournament. Then the Standings update automatically. Every tool we add is built with the admin’s user experience in mind.
## Sponsors
If someone sells a product that fits the community surrounding your game, we can carve out real estate right on the website. Regular visitors get consistent impressions.
## You
You want to show your game in its best light. The site we build is where it will shine brightest. Imagine a storied history of global competition that starts now and will be the premier destination for your competitive game for decades. Bring together players and spectators from all over the world to share their love of your games.
## Technical
On top of design, we’ll collaborate with your marketing team to maximize your sales. We can add special promotions, make the site multilingual, insert your sales data trackers, and integrate social media to help spread the word and drive traffic. And don’t worry about the technical side—we handle hosting, security, global content delivery, and all the necessary consent management for every site we build.
