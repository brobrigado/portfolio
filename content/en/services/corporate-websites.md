If you publish multiple games in multiple genres, have us build the site that helps you sell all of them. We’ll create a flagship website for your entire company that includes everything you need.
## Home
Share the latest and greatest in an easy-to-digest format that updates automatically as content is added to your site. This page can include a video and image slider, your latest news, featured games, newest merch, social feeds, and whatever else you’d like.
## News
Broadcast new releases, events, updates, seasons, patch notes, and more. If you have recurring types of news posts, we can build templates that make formatting a breeze.
## Games
Make it easy for everyone to find and buy the games they want. Our page technology lets you categorize by platform, genre, developer, publisher, and any other criteria you need. Age Gate technology is included as well. Finally, we integrate this page with your Home page so all your latest releases show up automatically.
## Events
If you organize, promote, or attend game-related functions regularly, we’ll include an Events feature. The main page can list all your upcoming events along with a link to show past engagements. Your Home page can automatically display what’s coming up next.
## Store
Here’s your chance to sell merch directly from your website or link to an external store. Our eCommerce platform makes it intuitive for fans to find what they want and complete their purchase even during the most exciting merch drops.
## Company
Build a bridge of familiarity and trust with your customers with a clear description of your mission and objectives. You can also share information about your team, founders, or key people involved. Finally tell the story of how the business developed the core values, principles, and beliefs to which you adhere.
## Technical
On top of design, we’ll collaborate with your marketing team to maximize your sales. We can add special promotions, make the site multilingual, insert your sales data trackers, and integrate social media to help spread the word and drive traffic. And don’t worry about the technical side—we handle hosting, security, global content delivery, and all the necessary consent management for every site we build.
