description: "The success of the Street Fighter 25th finals ushered in the very first CAPCOM Cup. We saw it announced online, discovered that all the info was limited to a jpeg and some text, and made a phone call to Capcom that reshaped our company for the better. What followed was our opportunity to build a multi-page site featuring streamed matches showcasing the best players of Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and Street Fighter x Tekken"
