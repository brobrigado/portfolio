description: "Did you know that people love to sing the DuckTales theme song? We had no idea how much until we built this for CAPCOM to celebrate the release of DuckTales Remastered. Have you ever heard someone sing the DuckTales theme song in German WITH a Donald Duck accent? We have. It actually happened in one of the contest entries. The grand prizes for all the winning performers were epic."
